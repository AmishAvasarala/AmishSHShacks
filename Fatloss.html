        <h1>Fat loss workout</h1>
        <h2>Warmup</h2>
        <p>--10 minutes light cardio</p>
          <p>--pushups with weight, 8 reps of 3 sets , increase 5lb weight if you can handle 25 reps nonstop, test once a week </p>
          <h3>Cardiovascular excercise</h3>
        <p>Any form of cardio you enjoy; this can be sprinting, swimming, cycling, playing a sport, do for at least 20-30 minutes per day up to 1 hr(add 1.5 min break in between reps if sprinting)</p>

        <h3>Strength</h3>
        <p>Strength training is also crucial to weight loss. More muscle means higher metabolism and building lean muscle mass promotes more fat burning.
          Do squats, lunges, deadlifts, bench press, shoulder press, and rows. Perform 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps for each exercise, with a weight that is challenging but allows you to maintain proper form.</p>
          <p>High-intensity interval training (HIIT):
            HIIT involves alternating periods of high-intensity exercise with periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise.
            For example, you could do 30 seconds of all-out sprinting followed by 60 seconds of walking or slow jogging, and repeat this cycle for 10-20 minutes.

              Cool-down: Finish your workout with 5-10 minutes of stretching to help reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility.
              Here are some stretches you should do:
<br>
<br>

<h4> Hamstring stretch:</h4> Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you. Reach forward and try to touch your toes, holding the stretch for 20-30 seconds.

<h4>Quadriceps stretch: </h4> Stand on one leg and lift the other leg behind you, holding onto your ankle or foot with your hand. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds before switching sides.

<br>
<br>
Only static stretch at the end of the workout as a cooldown or after a proper warm up if you are only stretching to improve flexibility, as stretching without warming up can result in injury.
In addition, avoid bouncing or jerking movements which can also increase the risk of injury.
